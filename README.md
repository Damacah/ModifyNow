## Installing Mods

With this tool, you can select mods and move them directly into the `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods` folder. You can install mods from .zip or .jar files.

You also have the option to delete old mods from the folder when doing so.

## Language Support

You can switch between English and Spanish. English is the default.

## IMPORTANT

This tool does **not** install any mod loader on your computer (such as forge/fabric). It only moves the mods into the correct folder.

If you need to install a mod loader, please visit their official websites.

## Other Info

This tool was originally created in 2023 because some friends kept asking me where to move Minecraft mods. It was first built using C# and Windows Forms. Later, I decided to remake it in Python to make it simpler and portable. The old version is still available in the `old` folder in the source code.
