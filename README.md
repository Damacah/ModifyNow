# ModifyNow

ModifyNow is an easy tool to install Minecraft mods. 
It is made in C# and WindowsForms (I know, a little bit outdated).

## Installing mods

With this tool, you can do two primary things:

Install mods: It will delete all the mods in the mods folder and move in the new mods. You can install mods from a RAR/ZIP, by selecting a folder (it puts all the JAR files in the mods folder) and by manually selecting the RAR files.

Update mods: It won't delete the mods in the mods folder, it will just add the new mods. You can add mods from a RAR/ZIP or by selecting JAR files.

## Language change

It offers a language change between English and Spanish. English is the default language.

## IMPORTANT

This tool won't install any mod loader on your computer (such as forge/fabric). It will put the mods into the .minecraft/mods folder in order to make it easier and faster for all the users.

If you want to install these mod loaders, do that by going into their official websites.

## Please,

This is one of my first projects, don't blame me for bad code or for putting the translations on the code (I know, it is really bad). Thanks for taking the time to read this, and enjoy this tool!
